    <p>This show follows the lives of a 32-year-old  mother Lorelai Gilmore and her intellectual teenage daughter Rory Gilmore. The two women have big ambitions they try desperately to achieve: Lorelai wants to own her own inn, while Rory wants to attend Harvard University. They also deal with Lorelai's appearance-obsessive and very wealthy parents, Emily and Richard Gilmore, who pay Rory's tuition at an exclusive private school in Hartford, Connecticut. In exchange, Rory and Lorelai have to come to Emily and Richards house for dinner every Friday night.</p>
